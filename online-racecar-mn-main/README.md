# BWSI Racecar Middle School - Official RACECAR-MN Labs

## Update!

We have updated this repository to use Python 3! We are also updating to the current GitHub default branch naming. So the previous `python3` branch is now `main`, and the previous `master` branch is now `python2`. We hope this will reduce confusion going forward.

There are other substantive changes. We are using ROS 2. And we are using the RealSense library directly to get camera images, rather than getting them via OpenCV. That gives better performance, and much more flexibility / options in dealing with the camera.
